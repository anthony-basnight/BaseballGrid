# BaseballGrid

In this project, you are given a 3x3 grid with baseball teams as the row and column headers. For each point in the grid, you need to name a player in baseball history who has played for both of the teams at that intersection. It uses the database from the Baseball Reference website to verify that a guess is correct. 

I was inspired to make this on my own after learning about the game that is now called Immaculate Grid. Back when I started coding this up for fun, Immaculate Grid didn't exist, but now it is a full game owned by Baseball Reference.
